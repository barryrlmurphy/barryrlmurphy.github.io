      'Very interesting book. It has a look at the current wave of populism and anti-globalisation sweeping countries across the world. The author talks about the 3 pillars of society, community, state, markets and the need for them to be in balance. In different periods of history trouble occurs if one pillar becomes too dominant. He argues the current backlash is as a consequence of the markets and state pillars becoming to powerful at the expense of community. Really interesting read.',

It was something different for me to read as I tend to read a lot of entrepreneurs and personal development books lately. He had to make some serious sacrifices and endure some tough times in order to achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut. Massive amount of time away from his family and massive personal criticism all the time of his performance in training for his missions. Interesting and inspiring.',

This book demystifies all the scariness around investing money. Diversified index funds, the miracle of compound interest, making your money work for you and dollar cost averaging. Read this book!',
